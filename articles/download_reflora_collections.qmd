Here in this article, we show how to use the package's function `reflora_summary` for summarizing information about all REFLORA-associated collections.\
\

## Download all specimen records

\
The following code can be used to download original specimen records in Darwin Core Format and associated metada for all REFLORA collections.\
\

``` r
reflora_download(verbose = TRUE,
                 dir = "reflora_download")
```

## Download specimen records for specific collections

\
By specifying a vector of herbarium acronyms, the user can download specimens records for just the specific herbarium collection.\
\

``` r
reflora_download(herbarium = c("ALCB", "HUEFS", "RB", "US", "K"),
                 verbose = TRUE,
                 dir = "reflora_download")
```
